// Logging:
// Apply decorators to log method calls, inputs, outputs, and execution times. This helps in debugging and understanding how your code is working.

// Authentication and Authorization:
// Use decorators to enforce authentication and authorization checks on specific methods or classes. This ensures that only authorized users can access certain parts of your application.

// Caching:
// Decorators can be used to implement caching for expensive or frequently used methods, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.

// Validation:
// Apply decorators to validate inputs to methods, ensuring that the data meets specific criteria before the method executes.
